# Git Workflows That Actually Work in Teams

Edition #7 covers practical Git workflows for effective team collaboration.

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow

Traditional but effective for release-based workflows:

```bash
# Main branches
main (production)
develop (integration)

# Supporting branches
feature/* (new features)
release/* (release preparation)
hotfix/* (production fixes)
```

### GitHub Flow

Simpler, great for continuous deployment:

```bash
main (always deployable)
feature/* (short-lived feature branches)
```

### Trunk-Based Development

For high-velocity teams:

```bash
# Everyone commits to main
main

# Use feature flags for incomplete features
if (featureFlags.newDesign) {
  return <NewDesign />;
}
```

## Commit Conventions

### Conventional Commits

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

```bash
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation changes
style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
refactor: code refactoring
test: adding tests
chore: updating build tasks, etc.
```

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication

Implement OAuth2 flow with Google and GitHub providers

Closes #123

fix(api): handle null values in user profile

The API was throwing 500 errors when user profile
fields were null. Added null checks and default values.

Fixes #456
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

### PR Template

``markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
How has this been tested?

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-reviewed the code
- [ ] Commented complex logic
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Added tests
- [ ] All tests passing
``

### Review Guidelines

**For Authors:**
- Keep PRs small (< 400 lines)
- Write clear descriptions
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Be open to suggestions

**For Reviewers:**
- Be respectful and constructive
- Suggest alternatives, don't just criticize
- Approve when good enough, not perfect
- Explain your reasoning

## Useful Git Commands

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up your commit history:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Then in the editor:
pick a1b2c3d First commit
squash d4e5f6g Second commit
squash h7i8j9k Third commit
```

### Cherry Pick

Apply specific commits:

```bash
git cherry-pick abc123
```

### Stash

Save work in progress:

```bash
# Stash changes
git stash

# Stash with message
git stash save "WIP: working on auth"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply stash
git stash apply stash@{0}

# Apply and remove
git stash pop
```

### Bisect

Find the commit that introduced a bug:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # Current commit is bad
git bisect good abc123  # This commit was good

# Git will checkout commits for you to test
# After each test:
git bisect good  # or git bisect bad

# When found:
git bisect reset
```

## Merge vs Rebase

### When to Merge

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

# Creates a merge commit
# Preserves complete history
# Good for: public branches, feature integration
```

### When to Rebase

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

# Rewrites commit history
# Creates linear history
# Good for: private branches, cleaning up before PR
```

**Golden Rule:** Never rebase public branches!

## Handling Conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch
git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur:
# 1. Resolve conflicts in your editor
# 2. Stage resolved files
git add .

# 3. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Or abort if needed
git rebase --abort
```

## Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

npm run lint
npm run test
```

### Using Husky

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky

# package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm run lint",
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  }
}
```

## Semantic Versioning

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1.0.0 -> Initial release
1.0.1 -> Patch (bug fix)
1.1.0 -> Minor (new feature, backwards compatible)
2.0.0 -> Major (breaking change)
```

### Automated Versioning

```bash
# Install standard-version
npm install --save-dev standard-version

# Generate changelog and bump version
npm run release
```

## Protecting Branches

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
Required:
  - At least 1 approval
  - Pass status checks
  - Up to date with base branch
  - No force pushes
  - No deletions
```

## Git Aliases

Speed up your workflow:

```bash
# ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
  co = checkout
  br = branch
  ci = commit
  st = status
  unstage = reset HEAD --
  last = log -1 HEAD
  visual = log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
  amend = commit --amend --no-edit
```

## Monorepo Considerations

### Using Git Submodules

```bash
# Add submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git libs/repo

# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive <repo-url>

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote
```

### Using Git Subtree

```bash
# Add subtree
git subtree add --prefix=libs/repo https://github.com/user/repo.git main

# Update subtree
git subtree pull --prefix=libs/repo https://github.com/user/repo.git main
```

## Team Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# 2. Make commits following conventions
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login form"
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT validation"

# 3. Keep branch updated
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# 5. Address review feedback
git commit -m "refactor(auth): improve error handling"

# 6. Squash if needed (before merge)
git rebase -i origin/main

# 7. Merge when approved
# (Done via PR interface)

# 8. Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

## Troubleshooting

### Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Recover Deleted Branch

```bash
git reflog
git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>
```

### Clean Working Directory

```bash
# Remove untracked files
git clean -fd

# Preview what will be removed
git clean -fdn
```

## Conclusion

Good Git workflows are about communication and consistency. Choose what works for your team and stick to it!
