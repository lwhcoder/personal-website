# Modern CSS Techniques for 2024

CSS has evolved dramatically. Here are the techniques you should know.

## Container Queries

Finally, we can style elements based on their container size:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Organize your CSS with proper layering:

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer components {
  .button {
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
  }
}
```

## Has Selector

Target parents based on their children:

```css
.card:has(img) {
  display: grid;
}

form:has(:invalid) {
  border-color: red;
}
```

## Conclusion

Modern CSS gives us superpowers. Use them wisely!
