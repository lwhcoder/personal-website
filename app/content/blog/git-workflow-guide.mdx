# Git Workflow Guide: Mastering Version Control

Git is essential for modern development. Let's explore workflows and practices that will make you a Git expert.

## Git Flow: The Classic Workflow

Git Flow uses multiple branches for different purposes:

```bash
# Main branches
main        # Production-ready code
develop     # Integration branch

# Supporting branches
feature/*   # New features
release/*   # Release preparation
hotfix/*    # Production fixes
```

### Creating a Feature

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user login"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

## GitHub Flow: Simplified Workflow

A simpler approach for continuous deployment:

```bash
# 1. Create branch from main
git checkout -b add-search-feature

# 2. Make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add search functionality"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin add-search-feature

# 4. Review, test, merge to main
# 5. Deploy from main
```

## Trunk-Based Development

For fast-moving teams:

```bash
# Short-lived branches off main
git checkout -b fix-typo
# Quick fix
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in header"
git push origin fix-typo
# Immediate PR and merge
```

## Commit Message Conventions

Use conventional commits for clarity:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

feat: add user profile page
fix: resolve login redirect issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify auth logic
test: add unit tests for parser
chore: update dependencies
```

### Real Examples

```bash
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
fix(api): handle null user case
docs(readme): add installation steps
perf(db): optimize query performance
```

## Useful Git Commands

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up commit history:

```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Options:
# pick   - keep commit
# reword - change message
# squash - combine with previous
# drop   - remove commit
```

### Cherry-Pick

Apply specific commits:

```bash
# Apply commit from another branch
git cherry-pick abc1234
```

### Stash Changes

Temporarily save work:

```bash
# Save changes
git stash save "WIP: user dashboard"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply and keep stash
git stash apply stash@{0}

# Apply and remove stash
git stash pop
```

### Reset and Revert

```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Create new commit that undoes changes
git revert abc1234
```

## Branch Management

### Cleaning Up

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/old-feature

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/old-feature

# Prune deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune
```

### Viewing Branches

```bash
# All branches
git branch -a

# Branches with last commit
git branch -v

# Merged branches
git branch --merged
```

## Working with Remotes

```bash
# Add remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Fetch from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Sync with upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## .gitignore Best Practices

```text
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.min.js

# Environment
.env
.env.local

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/
```

## Git Hooks

Automate checks with hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Check commit message format
# ... validation logic ...
```

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When conflict occurs
git status  # See conflicted files

# Edit files to resolve conflicts
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD markers

# After resolving
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"
```

## Git Aliases

Speed up your workflow:

```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    last = log -1 HEAD
    visual = log --graph --oneline --all
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**: Small, focused commits
2. **Write Clear Messages**: Follow conventions
3. **Pull Before Push**: Stay in sync
4. **Review Before Commit**: Check `git diff`
5. **Use Branches**: Never commit directly to main
6. **Keep History Clean**: Use rebase when appropriate

## Conclusion

Mastering Git takes practice, but these workflows and commands will make you more efficient and confident in managing your code.

Happy versioning! 🚀
