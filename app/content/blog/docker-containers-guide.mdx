# Docker Containers: From Zero to Production

Docker has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications. Let's dive into containerization and learn how to leverage Docker effectively.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that packages applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are:

- **Lightweight**: Share the host OS kernel
- **Portable**: Run anywhere Docker is installed
- **Isolated**: Each container runs independently
- **Consistent**: Same environment from dev to prod

## Your First Dockerfile

Here's a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Multi-Stage Builds

Optimize your images with multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Docker Compose for Development

Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Official Base Images

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine  # ✅ Official, maintained
```

### 2. Minimize Layers

```dockerfile
# ❌ Multiple layers
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y git

# ✅ Single layer
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl git && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. Use .dockerignore

```text
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.env
*.md
```

### 4. Don't Run as Root

```dockerfile
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
USER nodejs
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Health Checks**: Add health checks to your containers
2. **Logging**: Use proper logging drivers
3. **Security Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities
4. **Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits
5. **Monitoring**: Track container metrics

## Conclusion

Docker is an essential tool for modern development. By following these practices, you'll create efficient, secure, and maintainable containerized applications.
