# Getting Started with React Server Components

React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. Let's dive into what makes them special.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are a new type of component that runs exclusively on the server. This means:

- Zero JavaScript sent to the client
- Direct access to backend resources
- Improved performance and SEO

## Example

Here's a simple server component:

```tsx
async function BlogPost({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const post = await db.posts.findById(id);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance** - Less JavaScript means faster load times
2. **Security** - Sensitive logic stays on the server
3. **Developer Experience** - Write code more naturally

## Conclusion

Server Components are the future of React development. Start experimenting with them today!
