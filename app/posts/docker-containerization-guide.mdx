# Complete Guide to Docker Containerization

Docker has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications. Let's explore containerization from the basics to advanced practices.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different environments.

## Creating Your First Dockerfile

A Dockerfile defines how to build your container image:

<AdvancedCode
  type="code"
  language="dockerfile"
  code={`# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]`}
/>

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Apps

Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers:

<AdvancedCode
  type="code"
  language="yaml"
  code={`version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myapp
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  redis_data:`}
/>

## Best Practices

### 1. Multi-stage Builds
Reduce image size by using multi-stage builds:

<AdvancedCode
  type="code"
  language="dockerfile"
  code={`# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["npm", "start"]`}
/>

### 2. Optimize Layer Caching
Order instructions from least to most frequently changing:

<AdvancedCode
  type="code"
  language="dockerfile"
  code={`FROM node:18-alpine

# Install system dependencies first (rarely changes)
RUN apk add --no-cache curl

# Copy package files (changes occasionally)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (changes when package.json changes)
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code (changes frequently)
COPY . .`}
/>

## Essential Docker Commands

<AdvancedCode
  type="command"
  commands={[
    { label: 'Build', code: 'docker build -t myapp .' },
    { label: 'Run', code: 'docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp' },
    { label: 'Compose up', code: 'docker-compose up -d' },
    { label: 'View logs', code: 'docker logs -f container_name' },
    { label: 'Clean up', code: 'docker system prune -a' }
  ]}
/>

## Security Considerations

- Run containers as non-root user
- Use official base images from trusted sources
- Regularly update base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Limit container resources

Docker containerization ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments while improving scalability and deployment efficiency!
